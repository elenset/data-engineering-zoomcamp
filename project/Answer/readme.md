# Data Engineering Zoomcamp Project: [Your Project Name]

## Presentation Overview

This project was completed as part of the Data Engineering Zoomcamp. It demonstrates an end-to-end data pipeline, from data ingestion and processing to data warehousing and visualization. This `README` provides an overview of the project, its objectives, the technologies used, and instructions on how to run the code. The final results of the project, including the dashboard and code, can be found in the [project-files-31-03.zip](https://github.com/elenset/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/project/files/project-files-31-03.zip) file.

## 1. Problem Statement

[Clearly and concisely describe the problem your project addresses. What real-world need does it fulfill?  What questions does it answer?  For example:]

This project aims to analyze [Name of Dataset] to understand [Specific problem or area of focus]. By creating a data pipeline and dashboard, we aim to provide insights into [Specific Insights].

## 2. Project Objectives

*   **Data Ingestion:** Create a pipeline to ingest data from [Source] into a data lake.
*   **Data Warehousing:** Move the data from the data lake to a data warehouse (e.g., BigQuery, Snowflake).
*   **Data Transformation:** Transform the data in the data warehouse to prepare it for analysis and visualization using [dbt, Spark, SQL].
*   **Dashboard Creation:** Build an interactive dashboard with at least two tiles to visualize key insights.

## 3. Data Pipeline

### 3.1 Type (Batch or Stream)

[Specify whether your pipeline is batch or stream.]

This project implements a **[Batch/Stream]** pipeline.

### 3.2 Architecture

[Describe the architecture of your data pipeline. Include a diagram if possible.]

The pipeline consists of the following stages:

1.  **Data Source:** [Describe the source of your data (e.g., API, CSV files, database).]
2.  **Data Ingestion:** [Describe how you ingest the data into the data lake. Mention the tools used (e.g., Airflow, custom scripts).]
3.  **Data Lake:** [Specify the data lake you used (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage).]
4.  **Data Warehousing:** [Describe how you move the data from the data lake to the data warehouse. Mention the tools used (e.g., Airflow, custom scripts).]
5.  **Data Warehouse:** [Specify the data warehouse you used (e.g., BigQuery, Snowflake).]
6.  **Data Transformation:** [Describe how you transform the data in the data warehouse. Mention the tools used (e.g., dbt, Spark, SQL).]
7.  **Dashboard:** [Specify the dashboard tool you used (e.g., Metabase, Data Studio).]

## 4. Technologies Used

*   **Cloud Provider:** [AWS, GCP, Azure]
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** [Terraform, Pulumi, Cloud Formation (if applicable)]
*   **Workflow Orchestration:** [Airflow, Prefect, Luigi]
*   **Data Warehouse:** [BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift]
*   **Batch Processing:** [Spark, Flink, AWS Batch (if applicable)]
*   **Stream Processing:** [Kafka, Pulsar, Kinesis (if applicable)]
*   **Transformation Tool:** [dbt, Spark, SQL]
*   **Dashboard Tool:** [Metabase, Data Studio, Tableau, etc.]

## 5. Dashboard

The dashboard provides insights into [mention the key areas of insights]. It includes the following tiles:

1.  **[Tile 1 Title]:** [Description of the first tile, including the type of graph and the data it visualizes.]
2.  **[Tile 2 Title]:** [Description of the second tile, including the type of graph and the data it visualizes.]

[You can include a screenshot of your dashboard here]

## 6. Reproducibility

To run this project, follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites:** [List any prerequisites, such as software installations or cloud account setup.]
2.  **Configuration:** [Describe how to configure the project, including setting environment variables or configuring cloud resources.]
3.  **Running the Pipeline:** [Provide instructions on how to run the data pipeline, including commands to execute and any dependencies.]
4.  **Accessing the Dashboard:** [Describe how to access the dashboard and view the visualizations.]
